# Overall Theme: Parameter Selection and Structure Evolution

 - Time Series Models

   - [X-ray Scattering Evolution Study](http://phelpsforpresident.github.io/MIC-XRD-Polymer/2014/12/12/Final-Post.html)

 - Parameter Estimation of Phase Field Model

    - Show [preliminary work](http://davidbrough.net/research-blog/post/2015/07/29/Time-Series-MKS_Varied_Initial_Conditions.html) with Cahn-Hilliard Model

    - Propose to extend work with Fipy model

 - Localization Structure Evolution

    - Show [preliminary work](http://davidbrough.net/research-blog/post/2016/02/18/Phase-Field-Simulation-Parameters.html) with Cahn-Hilliard Model

    - Propose to extend work with Fipy model

 - Time Series and Influence Coefficients (see images below)

   - Calibration of influence coefficients for each time step.
   - Do PCA on the set of influence coefficients.

   - Predict the evolution of the influence coefficients in PCA space with time series.
